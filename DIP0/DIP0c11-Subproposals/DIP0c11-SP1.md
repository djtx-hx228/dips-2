## Application Form
    
- **Motivation**
    - The Dijets Improvement Proposals Framework requires a DIP Editor when the framework becomes ratified. Given that I am closest to the process and am driven towards making the Protocol self-sustainable, I am propsing myself to take on the DIP Editor role. As the DIP Editor, I will support and enforce the administrative and editorial aspects of the overall DIPs process and framework. For the full list of resposibilities, please reference [DIP0c9: DIP Editor Role](https://github.com/lasthyphen/dips/blob/master/DIP0/dip0.md#dip0c9-dip-editor-role).
    - Additioanlly, as one of the architects of the framework, I will actively work with the community to help sheppard incoming DIPs and work and communicate with Governance Facilitators on coordinating governance and executive votes in relation to DIPs and the monthly governance cycle.
    - Lastly, I would like to note that the expectation is that the DIPs Framework will start out with a DIP Editor from the Maker Foundation (myself) and that other DIP Editors will join later.
