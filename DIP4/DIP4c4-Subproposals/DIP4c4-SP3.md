## Specification

### Motivation

[DIP23: Domain Structure and Roles](https://dips.makerdao.com/dips/details/DIP23) and [DIP28: Operational Support (OS) Domain Definition](https://dips.makerdao.com/dips/details/DIP28) were passed towards the end of 2020. The Domain framework has since been superseded by the Core Unit Framework and all necessary transitions from the former to the latter are long finished. Therefore, these DIPs no longer serve any purpose in MakerDAO and should be marked as Obsolete in the interest of keeping the DIPs Framework slim and reflective of the status quo.
