## Sentence Summary

DIP4c2-SP13 amends DIP0 to be more precise in regards to the management of DIP Sets.

## Specification

### Motivation

As it stands, DIP Sets are only allotted a definition in DIP0c1. This definition ---a state of affairs, the circumstance of having DIPs that are tightly interwoven--- is strictly correct. Procedural indications as to how to handle this state of affairs, however, are nowhere to be found. This Amendment Subproposal aims to correct this lack by adding a component `DIPc14: DIP Set Management` that defines:

- A procedure for tagging DIP Sets
- Roles involved and their responsibilities

This component also contains some general considerations that should be kept in mind when dealing with DIP Sets.

Changes to DIP0 are minimal. Replacing the document instead of amending it is not warranted.

These changes have no impact on any other DIP.
