## Sentence Summary

DIP4c2-SP2 amends DIP8 so that the Domain Greenlight process occur after the Community Greenlight Poll (DIP9).

## Specification

### Motivation

Today, the Domain Greenlight (DIP8) process occurs before the Community Greenlight Poll (DIP). This workflow increases the work required from Domain teams and reduces the time they can spend on doing domain work for onboarding collateral assets.

Therefore, this amendment DIP is proposing that the Domain Greenlight process (DIP8) should occur after the proposed collateral asset has passed the DIP9 Community Greenlight Poll allowing the Domain teams to use the Community Greenlight Poll results to make a more informed decision and proceed with their domain work. 

In summary, the amendments in this proposal affect the overall Collateral Onboarding DIPs Set and the previously ratified collateral onboarding process. More specifically, it rearanges the collateral onboarding process to allow DIP9 to occur before DIP8.
