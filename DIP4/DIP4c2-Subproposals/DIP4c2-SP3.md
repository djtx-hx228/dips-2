## Sentence Summary

DIP4c2-SP3 rearranges the collateral onboarding process to allow DIP9 to occur before DIP8.

## Specification
    
### Motivation

This amendment DIP proposes some minor language edits and addresses some inconsistencies detailed throughout DIP9. More specifically, the proposed change will update the DIP to be consistent in saying that the Community Greenlight process will occur before the Domain Greenlight process, that Community Greenlight Polls will run for two weeks (including the details as to when they begin and end), and separating the components to increase clarity surrounding the overall process requirements and outcomes. 

In summary, the amendments in this proposal affect the overall Collateral Onboarding DIPs Set and the previously ratified collateral onboarding process. More specifically, it rearranges the collateral onboarding process to allow DIP9 to occur before DIP8.
