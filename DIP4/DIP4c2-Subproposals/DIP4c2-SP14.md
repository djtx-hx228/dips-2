## Sentence Summary

DIP4c2-SP14 amends DIP0 with the intent of making it easier to read and navigate.

## Specification

### Motivation

Over time, DIP0 has accrued a moderately heavy baggage of outdated content and a somewhat lighter baggage of rushed edits and incoherence. We feel it is high time DIP0 got a revamp that trims down the excess, brings it up-to-date, and makes it less intimidating for the newcomer and easier to navigate for everyone.

Although not shy in reformatting and rewriting, the proposed changes neither add nor break any preexisting functionally relevant logic. We think this warrants their current collective presentation as an amendment rather than as a replacement.
