## Specification

### Motivation

- This DIP is being amended to become compatible with the Endgame Plan and prevent Signal Requests (non-standard weekly polls) from dominating the governance dynamic and acting as a vector for unpredictable complexity growth and governance overhead.
- This DIP Amendment only affects Signal Requests leading to non-standard weekly polls and doesn't change the standard and primary focus of DIP16

### Amended DIPs and Components

- DIP16 
    - DIP16c1 (Add the following bullet points)
        - To protect the integrity of existing DIPs, Signal Requests are only permitted when they are specifically triggered and required by an existing DIP.
        - This component explicitly forbids the possibility of community-triggered Signal Requests about arbitrary issues. It is also explicitly specified that the only way to make arbitrary changes to Maker Governance is through the full DIPs process or through Governance Mandates of Mandated Actors.
