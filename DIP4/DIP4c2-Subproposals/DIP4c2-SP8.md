## Sentence Summary

DIP4c2-SP8 introduces a second poll date on the 1st Monday of each month.

## Specification

### Motivation

This amendment DIP proposes changes to DIP9.

The monthly poll date means that in some scenarios, a collateral asset must wait up to 6 weeks for inclusion in the community greenlight poll since its DIP6 application. This amendment seeks to make such scenarios impossible by introducing a second poll date on the 1st Monday of each month, in addition to the 3rd Monday, thus ensuring the polls take place bi-monthly. The 14-day discussion and voting period is maintained.
