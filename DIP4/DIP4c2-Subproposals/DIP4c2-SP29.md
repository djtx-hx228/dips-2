## Specification

### Motivation

This amendment subproposal aims to change two aspects of the current [Recognized Delegate Compensation DIP](https://dips.makerdao.com/dips/details/DIP61).

#### Abstain Modifier

In the current form, DIP61 treats participation in on-chain polls uniformly, regardless of the vote Recognized Delegates are casting. This amendment removes the eligibility for compensation if a Recognized Delegate fails to meet a threshold of non-abstaining votes.

#### Higher Participation Requirements and Weighting for Executive Votes

For security and operational issues surrounding Executive Votes, participation on these should have a higher weight compared to on-chain polls and more strict requirements on timing.
