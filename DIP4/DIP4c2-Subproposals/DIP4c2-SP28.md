## Specification

### Motivation

[The December exception in DIP51](https://dips.makerdao.com/dips/details/DIP51#DIP51c4) has been made in a time with huge problems on getting anything done in the Maker on-chain governance. As we have a working delegate system now, this situation has improved a lot --- both participation in on-chain polls as well as passing executives is not an issue anymore. This amendment removes the December exception so we can continue to govern the protocol without a break. As the December exception has been the only one so far, this amendment will also remove the containing component as well. If we ever need to make an amendment reintroducing an exception, the component can be reintroduced again.

### Amended DIPs and Components
