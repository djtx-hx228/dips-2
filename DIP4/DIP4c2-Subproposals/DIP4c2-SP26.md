## Specification

### Motivation

The long RFC period for Facilitator offboardings creates uncertainty for the DAO, the Facilitator, and DAO partners. It can also hold up valuable work if the Facilitator in question is not fulfilling his mandate.

A Facilitator who should be offboarded should be offboarded quickly. A Facilitator who should not be offboarded benefits from having the proposal resolved quickly. If there is uncertainty, proposers always have the option of using more than the minimum time period.

In addition, the wording on facilitator offboarding could use improvement. Govalpha suggested some improvements that I have integrated into this amendment.

## Changes

DIP41c5 is amended to read

>### DIP41c5: Facilitator Offboarding
>
>This component is twofold:
>
>1. It describes how Facilitators are to be handled in the event of a Core Unit offboarding via DIP39c3.
>2. It establishes the process to offboard *Facilitators*. Full Core Unit offboardings are to be put forth via DIP39c3.
>
>#### 1. Facilitators and Core Unit Offboardings via DIP39c3
>
>If a Core Unit offboarding subproposal passes, the Facilitator(s) of the affected Core Unit immediately loses all special powers listed on DIP41c2/DIP41c3.
>
>The Facilitator becomes a *Retiring* Facilitator in charge of executing the unwinding process for the offboarding Core Unit (described on DIP39c3). If the Retiring Facilitator fails to execute the unwinding plan, an *Interim* Facilitator - further defined in DIP41c6 - will take over these responsibilities.
>
>#### 2. Facilitator Offboarding Process
>
>A Facilitator can be offboarded without having the Core Unit they are attached to being offboarded. An Interim Facilitator will take over responsibilities during the transition. A DIP41c4 subproposal proposing a new Facilitator should be submitted by the Interim Facilitator or by any other member of the Community.
>
>If a Facilitator wishes to voluntarily offboard, a DIP41c4 subproposal proposing a new Facilitator should be submitted by the Interim Facilitator or by any other member of the Community.
>
>If a Facilitator goes missing, an Interim Facilitator will take over responsibilities during the transition. A DIP41c4 subproposal proposing a new Facilitator should be submitted by the Interim Facilitator or by any other member of the Community.
>
>DIP41c5 subproposal parameters are:
>
>- Minimum Feedback Period: 2 weeks.
>- Minimum Frozen Period: 1 week.
>- Poll Duration: 1 week.
>
>DIP41c5 subproposals must use the template located at [DIP41c5-Subproposal-Template.md](https://github.com/lasthyphen/dips/blob/master/DIP41/DIP41c5-Subproposal-Template.md)
