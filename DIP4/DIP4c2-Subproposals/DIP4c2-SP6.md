## Sentence Summary

DIP4c2-SP6 adds a calendar exception: no governance cycle in the month of December.

## Specification
    
### Motivation

Although Maker is intended to be a global protocol, in its current state the majority of the active members of governance are located in the United States or Europe. Both these regions have winter holidays that would clash with the conclusion of a monthly governance cycle in December. It is hoped that this exception can be removed in the future when governance of the protocol is more globally distributed.

This change is an addition and makes no modification to the current contents of DIP3 beyond preventing a monthly governance cycle in December, due to this, I feel that it is valid for an amendment and not a replacement of DIP3.

This change has no impact on other DIPs that interact with DIP3, with the exception of preventing new DIPs or subproposals from moving into Formal Submission in December.

### Amended Components

- DIP3c4 has been added to DIP3. There are no other changes. 
- DIP3c4 states that there will be no monthly governance cycle in the month of December.
