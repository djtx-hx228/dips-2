## Sentence Summary

DIP4c2-SP4 allows collateral onboarding to operate without having General Risk Model ratified through DIP11.

## Specification

### Motivation

This amendment DIP proposes a change to DIP12 to allow the collateral onboarding process to operate more efficiently. More specifically, it states that collateral onboarding can continue to operate despite not having an official General Risk Model ratified through the DIP11 process. 

This amendment DIP specifically impacts DIP12 subproposals. The update will allow DIP12 subproposals to be proposed to the governance cycle without needing a General Risk Model officially ratified in order for risk domain teams to provide risk constructs for the greenlit collateral assets.

### Amended Components

More specifically, changing the risk team's requirements to allow DIP12 subproposals to be proposed to the governance cycle without needing a General Risk Model officially ratified in order to provide risk constructs for collateral assets (note that this holds true until a second, non-Foundation domain risk team has been ratified through the DIP7 process).
