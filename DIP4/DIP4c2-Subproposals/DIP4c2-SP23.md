## Specification

### Motivation

DIP50 was too specific to lending protocols. I've updated it for the V2 rewrite which covers all external protocols that allow users to `deposit` / `withdraw` DAI. I've updated the DIP to remove details of the targeting mechanism as that is no longer important.

### Amended DIPs and Components

This DIP4c2 subproposal revises [DIP50](https://dips.makerdao.com/dips/details/DIP50).
