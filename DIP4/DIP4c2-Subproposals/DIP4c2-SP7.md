## Sentence Summary

DIP4c2-SP7 allows DIP amendments to use the weekly governance cycle for the first three months after a DIP has passed. It also allows multiple DIP amendments/removals in one proposal.

## Specification

### Motivation

This amendment DIP proposes changes to DIP4.

The first change is an allowance for DIP amendments to be able to use the Weekly Governance Cycle for the first 3 months after a DIP has passed. Using the weekly cycle will get an amendment ratified as quickly as 3 weeks instead of 2 months with the original process. This grants new DIPs greater flexibility to be fixed early and fast, improving overall governance efficiency.

The second being an allowance for multiple DIP amendments to happen in one proposal. This is to make it convenient to mass-amend DIP sets that often have dependencies on each other. The amendments would be change-centric rather than DIP-centric.

The third being an allowance for multiple DIP removals to happen in one proposal. This is to make it convenient to mass-remove DIP sets that often have dependencies on each other. The removals would be change-centric rather than DIP-centric.
