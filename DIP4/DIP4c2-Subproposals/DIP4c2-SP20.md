## Specification

### Motivation

DIP4c2-SP20 amends [DIP16](https://dips.makerdao.com/dips/details/DIP16) to reflect the changes to the weekly Executive Vote cadence proposed by the Protocol Engineering Core Unit [here](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/governance-cadence-improvement/14972). This change has been proposed to give engineering and governance teams greater time to confirm, write and include protocol changing parameters into spells in a much safer and less pressured manner than has been done previously.

We are also taking the opportunity to recognize that Governance Facilitators may elect not to have an Executive Vote in weeks when there are no significant changes required in the Maker Protocol. While this power could be inferred previously, by including it in DIP16 this process is made more transparent.

This subproposal amends the Weekly Governance Cycle Breakdown defined in DIP16c2 and, consequently, an amendment is appropriate rather than a complete replacement DIP.

### Amended DIPs and Components

- **DIP16c2: Weekly Governance Cycle Breakdown**
    - Re-wrote the Governance Cycle Breakdown to reflect it is running from Monday, week 1, until Wednesday, week 2.
    - Updated the Important Notes section to account for weeks where there won't be an Executive Vote and to acknowledge that there will be two Weekly Governance Cycles running concurrently.
    - Replaced the image illustrating the Weekly Governance Cycle.
