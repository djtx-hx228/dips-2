## Specification

### Motivation

This amendment for DIP55: Special Purpose Fund aims to improve the clarity of the original DIP text, allowing a clear distinction between which DIP55c3 subproposal may enter the Weekly Cycle and which has to enter the Monthly Governance Cycle, their respective Feedback and Frozen Periods, and giving much needed clarification for proposals of exactly 50k DAI. This amendment also brings some minor typo fixes to DIP55c1 and DIP55c2.

### Amended DIPs and Components

- Paragraph Summary
   - Clarified amount of Dai needed for DIP55c3 subproposals to enter the Weekly/Monthly Cycle.
