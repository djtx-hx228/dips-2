### 5: Constitutional Voter Committees (CVCs)

#### 5.1: Voter Committee Definition

Voter Committees are groups of MKR holders that publicly coordinate to analyze the best voting behaviour based on a particular strategy, and publicly coordinate political positioning with other Voter Committees and voting blocs to reach compromises and middle grounds that minimize bad decisions. The base form of Voter Committees are the Permissionless Voter Committees which is a very simple designation for any kind of organized voting group.

#### 5.2: Constitutional Voter Committee (CVC) Definition

CVCs are standardized Voter Committees made up of Constitutional Conservers that participate above a minimum level in the Maker Governance process. They are subject to specific requirements, and receive various benefits, resources and support from the Ecosystem Scope.

#### 5.3: Governance Strategy Position Documents

The core task of CVCs is the consistent creation of Governance Strategy Position Documents for each of the 12 Scopes. The total collection of all latest Governance Strategy Position Documents of a CVC together form the up-to-date guidelines of the CVCs Governance Strategy, which Constitutional Delegates can follow in order to achieve Rank 1 and gain a favorable position in the EGFs.

#### 5.4: Constitutional Voter Committee Recognition Process

Permissionless Voter Committees can become recognized as CVCs by the Arbitration Scope if they fulfill the CVC eligibility requirements for participation and internal governance for at least one full quarterly governance cycle. If at any time after becoming recognized as a CVC, the CVC no longer completely fulfills all of the eligibility requirements, it immediately loses its recognition as a CVC.

##### 5.4.1: A CVC must have at least one registered CVC Member that is a Constitutional Conserver and that has publicly verified ownership of MKR, based on the process for verifying MKR as specified in the Arbitration Scope.
----
##### 5.4.2: A CVC must follow a standardized internal governance process for determining membership, creation of Governance Strategy Position Documents, and other decisions.
  ###### 5.4.2.1: CVC Members vote on CVC decisions based on their relative ownership of verified MKR.
  ###### 5.4.2.2: New CVC Members are included based on an application that is either accepted or rejected through a CVC decision.
  ###### 5.4.2.3: Existing CVC Members can be removed through a CVC decision.
  ###### 5.4.2.4: A minority quorum of CVC Members based on verified MKR can trigger a CVC split. The Arbitration Scope determines the minority quorum. All CVC Members then vote to support one of two new CVCs, with the naming rights and infrastructure inhereted by the side with more MKR in support. The CVC Members of each of the two new CVCs is determined based on who voted to support each side.
  ###### 5.4.2.4.1: During the Pregame all Governance Strategy control also transfers fully to the side with more MKR --- however this is not sustainable as it discourages the minority in an internal CVC dispute, and in the Endgame Maker Constitution must be changed to the voter strategy control splitting proportionally based on MKR amounts in support of each side.
----
##### 5.4.3: A CVC must, through a CVC decision, create a legitimate Governance Strategy Scope Position Document for each of the 12 Scopes, each quarterly governance cycle. CVCs must also convene a CVC Subcomittee Meeting to discuss the creation of the Governance Strategy Scope Position Document for each of the 12 Scopes, each quarterly cycle.
