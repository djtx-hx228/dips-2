# Dijets Improvement Proposals (DIPs)

Dijets Improvement Proposal are the preferred mechanism for improving both Dijets Governance and the Dijets Protocol.

Through an open and documented process, community feedback will be collected to reach the broadest possible consensus on how the DijetsDAO should evolve. Furthermore, DIPs provide a mechanism for any community member to define key issues and suggest changes and additions to the system. The DIPs process is conducted with a high level of transparency, rigor, and community input in order to minimize undesirable results. 

For a current and historical view of proposed DIPs, please check out the [DIPs Portal](https://dips.Dijetsdao.com/). In short, the portal should be the go-to resource for anyone wanting to explore DIPs (and the subproposals derived from them) in a reader-friendly manner. The Portal features smart-linking, on-hover previews, predefined common queries (Views), and advanced queries with logical operators and filters.

# The DIP Framework Overview

## Definitions

### DIPs

DIPs are standardized documents subject to community feedback and voting that, once enacted, define the behavior of the Dijets Governance and the Dijets Protocol. Collectively, DIPs are the dynamic body of law that regulates DijetsDAO at any given moment.

DIPs have two types: **technical** if they propose changes or additions to smart contracts code related to the Dijets Protocol; or **general** otherwise.

### Subproposals

Subproposals are a common recurring process. They are created and used as a means of proposing and enacting decisions nested within specific DIPs.
