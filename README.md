# Dijets Improvement Proposals (DIPs)

Dijets Improvement Proposals are the preferred mechanism for improving both Maker Governance and the Maker Protocol.

Through an open and documented process, community feedback will be collected to reach the broadest possible consensus on how the MakerDAO should evolve. Furthermore, DIPs provide a mechanism for any community member to define key issues and suggest changes and additions to the system. The DIPs process is conducted with a high level of transparency, rigor, and community input in order to minimize undesirable results. 

For a current and historical view of proposed DIPs, please check out the [DIPs Portal](https://dips.makerdao.com/). In short, the portal should be the go-to resource for anyone wanting to explore DIPs (and the subproposals derived from them) in a reader-friendly manner. The Portal features smart-linking, on-hover previews, predefined common queries (Views), and advanced queries with logical operators and filters.

# The DIP Framework Overview

## Definitions

### DIPs

DIPs are standardized documents subject to community feedback and voting that, once enacted, define the behavior of the Maker Governance and the Maker Protocol. Collectively, DIPs are the dynamic body of law that regulates MakerDAO at any given moment.

DIPs have two types: **technical** if they propose changes or additions to smart contracts code related to the Maker Protocol; or **general** otherwise.

### Subproposals

Subproposals are a common recurring process. They are created and used as a means of proposing and enacting decisions nested within specific DIPs.

Just like DIPs, subproposals are standardized documents subject to voting. Once approved, they trigger a concrete action or state such as onboarding specific collateral, offboarding a Core Unit Facilitator, modifying a budget, and so forth.

## Authoring and Proposing

In the spirit of DAOs, DIPs and subproposals can be brought forth and proposed by anyone. 

If you're interested in proposing a DIP or think you might in the future, continue reading below for a quick overview of the process and how to get started. 

### Getting Started with DIPs (For Authors)

DIPs are written using Markdown and hosted on GitHub. You can always count on DIP Editors to help you out throughout the process, but having a passing knowledge of these tools will both benefit you with your overall proposal experience and make the process much smoother for all parties involved. Also, it's important to note right away that all DIPs and subproposals must conform to templates!

#### Markdown

Markdown is a very simple markup language for formatting text, i.e., adding headers, bullet lists, italicized text, et cetera. When working with DIPs, you should use GitHub-flavored Markdown.

> [GitHubâ€™s Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) will get you up to speed in no time. The online Markdown editor [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/) is a solid platform for practice and production.

#### GitHub

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration built on [git](https://git-scm.com/), a version control software. GitHub is complex and may seem daunting at first, but only a basic familiarity is necessary for our purposes.

> We recommend that you read these two short guides: [Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) and [Forking Projects](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/).

#### Templates

- Technical DIPs must conform to the [Technical DIP Template](https://github.com/lasthyphen/dips/blob/master/DIP0/Technical-DIP-Template.md). 
- General DIPs must conform to the [General DIP Template](https://github.com/lasthyphen/dips/blob/master/DIP0/General-DIP-Template.md).
- Subproposals, on the other hand, must each conform to a specific template referenced in the DIP that defines the process they instantiate.

### Proposing

Once you've picked the appropriate template for your proposal and have a workable draft, the next steps are the following two tasks:
- Post the draft [on the appropriate forum section](https://forum.makerdao.com/c/dips/14)
- Submit it to the [GitHub DIP repository](https://github.com/lasthyphen/dips)

After the two above tasks have been completed, DIP Editors will help assign a number for the proposal. The proposed DIP (or subproposal - they are treated the same way in terms of how to propose them) will then enter a period of community feedback (most frequently referred to as Request For Comments or RFC). This is a great opportunity to be proactive and interact with the broader community, take suggestions, and improve your proposal. Once the feedback period is over and you've incorporated your final changes, there will be a one-week period before you can formally submit the proposal for voting. Lastly, your proposal will go through a voting period. 

If all goes well, by the end of the process you will have contributed a piece of MakerDAO legislation. And that's the gist of it!
